      <h2 class="body-header">What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Emotional Intelligence is the ability to understand, use, and manage
        one's emotions. It is also the ability to recognise and relate emotions
        to the people around you.

      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Researchers, John Mayer and Peter Salovey, first conceived the term in
        1990 and later it was popularised by Daniel Goleman (a psychologist).

      <p class="body-paragraph">
        It's important to note that EQ and IQ are not inherit, unchangeable
        qualities, and that a person's environment that affect on's EQ and IQ.
        The measurements of EQ and IQ can also be affected by bias hence leading
        to limitations in these tests.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        EQ test results are not an accurate predictor of academic and work
        success because the test results are subjective. Often times, people
        want to do well on the test so may not answer accurately. Also factors
        such as upbringing, experiences, cultural factors, and trauma can affect
        one's EQ results.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        IQ testing is limited in that they do not reveal the underlying
        cognitive processes of a person. Also because of the certain type of
        questions asked in this test, it can reflect bias against minorities or
        other cultures.
      </p>
      <!-- Q3-->
      <h2 class="body-header">Why is EQ important?</h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        We live in a world that involves interacting with many different types
        of people. We also live in a world that is changing and we may be thrown
        with surprises in our lives. By having a heightened ability to
        recognise, understand, and manage our emotions and those of others, this
        can allow people to live harmoniously with others in any situation. It
        also allows people to respond effectively to changes, stressful
        situations, and obstacles.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        There are five components of Emotional Intelligence and I will explain
        each their importance:
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        <em><strong>1. Self-Awareness:</strong></em>
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        This is the ability to recognise what you're feeling, and understanding
        the effect of one's emotions and actions on other people. It is the
        understanding of their triggers and roots of their patterns of thinking
        and feeling. People who are self-aware have clarity in their beliefs,
        values and needs.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        The importance of being self-aware is that it can help people recognise
        their strengths and limitations. By doing so, it can help cultivate
        one's growth and development by understanding the strengths to help them
        reach a goal but also understanding the weaknesses they have to overcome
        or grow in.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Also, by knowing ourselves internally, we can also know how to operate
        externally.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        <em><strong>2. Self-Regulation:</strong></em>
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        It is being able to regulate and manage one's emotions and impulses. It
        is essentially thinking before acting and considering the consequences.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Feeling strong emotions is a very human experience. However, it is
        important to learn how to process those emotions and respond with
        appropriate behaviour because if we lack emotional regulation, it can
        lead to perpetuating the negative emotions which is a damaging
        consequence to oneself and our social relationships.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        <em><strong>3. Motivation:</strong></em>
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Motivation is being aware of what motivates them - why a person does
        something. It is what initiates, guides, and maintains goal-oriented
        behaviours. Emotionally intelligent people are motivated by things
        beyond money or fame.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Motivation is important because it is the driving force of human action.
        High-quality motivation can allow people to achieve goals. Without
        motivation, you cannot achieve anything.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Positive motivation can give you the desire to change life for the
        better, it enables you to prioritise things in your life in order to
        achieve the goal, it can help you overcome obstacles as you chase your
        goal, it can give you the correct attitude towards tasks no matter how
        hard it will be.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        <em><strong>4. Empathy:</strong></em>
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        This is the ability to consider other people's feeling especially when
        making decisions. It is also understanding what other people are going
        through and being able to respond kindly and thoughtfully. Essentially
        it is putting yourself in another person's shoes.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        In a professional lens, empathy is important because it allows you to
        better understand customers, colleagues, and help make beneficial
        decisions for the company.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        In general life, empathy is important because it allows you understand
        others, and let others know that they heard. More likely, in return,
        they can empathise with you as well. This in return can strengthen the
        bonds that we interact with. As humans, we all have an inherent desire
        to be seen and heard.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        <em><strong>5. Social Skills:</strong></em>
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        This is the ability to interact well with others - through the
        consideration of how you're feeling, what other's are feeling, and being
        an effective communicator.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Like the reasons provided for the above components, Social Skills are
        important to create and maintain relationships. Social connection allows
        us to feel a sense of belonging - by bonding our attitudes, values, and
        goals. A sense of belonging also comes with a sense of purpose, which
        can increase solidarity and fulfilment. Connection also allows us to
        have access to a support network of peers, can be a source of joy,
        expose us to a diversity of ideas, viewpoint, and personalities.
