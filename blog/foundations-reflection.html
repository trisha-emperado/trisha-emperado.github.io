        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego

      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Three new things I have learnt about myself is that I am more capable
        than I really think, I can get quite impatient with myself when I don‚Äôt
        understand something instantly, and that I really don‚Äôt like failure (I
        am scared to fail) which can paralyse me sometimes from starting
        something new.

      <!-- Q2 -->
      <h2 class="body-header">
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Values are important in learning and programming so that you remain as
        someone true to yourself in this journey.
        <br />
        <br />
        Empathy is important as learning in Dev Academy and programming overall
        involves a community. It is important to be able to understand people,
        where they are coming from, and how to work cooperatively with them.
        <br />
        <br />
        Self-awareness is important so that one can know their strengths and
        weaknesses. So they know what to focus on best and also know where/when
        to ask help. It is is also important so you know when to take rest when
        you are aware of burning out.

      <!-- Q3 -->
      <h2 class="body-header">
        What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
      </h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        That having a growth mindset is important in order to provide us a
        healthy relationship with success and failure. Failure is something I
        don‚Äôt want to experience, but it is all part of the growing process -
        it‚Äôs part of life.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <!-- Q4 -->
      <h2 class="body-header">
        What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
      </h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        I think it was implementing what I‚Äôve learnt to my practical life.
        Sometimes learning something, doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean it will change me
        instantly at that moment. Though I know failure is all part of the
        learning process, there have been moments I was pulling my hair out when
        I couldn‚Äôt get certain code working.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <!-- Q5 -->
      <h2 class="body-header">
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        I think it‚Äôs so that we become better programmers. Good programmers are
        those who can pick themselves up in facing daily challenges, one that
        works well in a group, a good communicator, and a good listener.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <!-- Q6 -->
      <h2 class="body-header">
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
        time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
        instead? Justify your answer.
      </h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        I think that because I delve into the core research quite a lot, it felt
        like I was wasting coding study time - but that was on my part of
        focusing too much on it. But I think the aspect of learning about growth
        was definitely helpful while I was learning programming. Learning the
        technical skills was about facing challenges ALL the time so it was good
        to have a good core foundation in order to face the challenges.
