    <!-- What is Position-->
    <div class="body">
      <h2 class="body-header">What is position?</h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        <code>position</code> is a CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) element, and as
        the name of the element suggests, <code>position</code> specifies how
        the element should be <em>positioned</em> in a document.
      </p>
      <!-- Normal Flow of a Document-->
      <h2 class="body-header">Normal Flow of a Document</h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Before looking at position elements, I think it is important to
        understand the <strong>normal flow</strong> of a document.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        An HTML document without any CSS is rendered on a browser by the order
        that the HTML is written. HTML elements such as
        <code> &lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> ,
        <code> &lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</code>,
        <code> &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; </code>(and many more) are
        <strong>block</strong> elements which means it's space that it takes up
        on a webpage always starts on a new line and fills up the horizontal
        space from left to right on a webpage (full width of the window). Hence,
        a <strong>block</strong> element written on HTML followed by another
        block element, the normal flow is from top to down.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        While the HTML elements of
        <code>&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code>,
        <code>&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code>,
        <code>&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;</code> (and many more as well) are
        <strong>inline</strong> which means that they are ordered from left to
        right (like reading ordinary text). The normal flow for
        <strong>inline</strong> elements is left to right, and down.
      </p>
      <!-- Static Position: The Default-->
      <h2 class="body-header">Static Position: The Default</h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        HTML elements are given a CSS of <code>position: static</code> by
        <strong>default.</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        This means that elements appear as they are written in the HTML
        document.
      </p>

      <p class="body-paragraph">For example:</p>
      <p class="example"><em>HTML</em></p>
      <img
        class="screenshot-img"
        src="../images/Static-HTML.png"
        alt="screenshot of HTML"
      />
      <p class="example"><em>CSS</em></p>
      <img
        class="screenshot-img"
        src="../images/Static-CSS.png"
        alt="screenshot of CSS"
      />
      <p class="example"><em>Outcome:</em></p>
      <img
        class="screenshot-img"
        src="../images/Static.png"
        alt="screenshot of the outcome of the CSS styling on HTML"
      />
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Notice how the coloured squares are positioned from top to down as they
        are a
        <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>
        HTML elements which means they are <strong>block</strong>. These squares
        are given the CSS default position of <strong>static</strong> - as they
        are positioned according to the Normal Flow of the document.
      </p>
      <!-- Relative Position-->
      <h2 class="body-header">Relative Position</h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Relative position means “relative to itself” - think of it as it needs
        to have an “anchor” so it knows where it should move in relation to. I
        will explain further…
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        If you just give an element
        <code>position: relative</code>
        this will have no effect on the position, and essentially be left as
        <code>static</code> . But if you give it <em>another</em> position
        attribute, eg <code>left: 20px</code> , then the element will position
        away from itself to the left RELATIVE from where it should normally be.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        The offset of the position is based on the values of
        <code>top</code>, <code>right</code>, <code>bottom</code>,
        <code>left</code>, and the offset does not affect the position of the
        other elements. The element retains its flow in the document.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        This is useful position trick for when you want to manipulate certain
        elements position on the page.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        For example, I will change the <code>position</code> CSS element to
        <code>relative</code> for the blue square and I will change the offset
        value for <code>top</code> and <code>left</code> to see how this changes
        the position on the webpage:
      </p>
      <p class="example"><em>CSS</em></p>
      <img
        class="screenshot-img"
        src="../images/Relative-CSS.png"
        alt="screenshot of CSS"
      />
      <p class="example"><em>Outcome:</em></p>
      <img
        class="screenshot-img"
        src="../images/Relative.png"
        alt="screenshot of the outcome of the CSS styling on HTML"
      />
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        I don't know about you, but seeing the outcome first got me confused! My
        expectation of the position was that it would move 20px up and 60px
        left… NOOOOO. I was very wrong. Let's look at this further…
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">Just remember how it looked:</p>

      <span>
        <p class="body-paragraph">before:</p>
        <img
          class="screenshot-small-img"
          src="../images/Static.png"
          alt="screenshot of the outcome of the CSS styling on HTML"
        />
        <p class="body-paragraph">and after:</p>
        <img
          class="screenshot-small-img"
          src="../images/Relative.png"
          alt="screenshot of the outcome of the CSS styling on HTML"
        />
      </span>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        When we applied
        <code>position:relative</code> , <code>top: 20px </code>,
        <code>left: 60px</code>... we are saying that from it's normal position
        we specified that it will move AWAY from the top by 20px (hence moved
        down by 20px). We also specified that it will move AWAY from the left
        60px (hence moved to the right).
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Notice how the other square's positions did not get affected.
      </p>
      <!-- Absolute Position-->
      <h2 class="body-header">Absolute Position</h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Absolute position means you can place the element any where you want it
        by using the offset data values: <code>top</code>, <code>right</code>,
        <code>bottom</code>, <code>left</code> The element is removed from the
        Normal Flow of the document which means that there is no space for the
        element in the page (like the element is no longer there).
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        The value that you set for your position will be in relation to the next
        parent element. If there is no parent element, then it will be placed in
        accordance to the HTML element and be placed in relation to the page
        itself.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        For example, let's change the position for the blue square:
      </p>
      <p class="example"><em>CSS</em></p>
      <img
        class="screenshot-img"
        src="../images/Absolute-CSS.png"
        alt="screenshot of CSS"
      />
      <p class="example"><em>Outcome</em></p>
      <img
        class="screenshot-img"
        src="../images/Absolute .png"
        alt="screenshot of outcome of CSS"
      />
      <p class="body-paragraph">What do we notice here?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I see that now the green square occupies the space where the blue
          square was originally placed.
        </li>
        <li>
          The blue square is on top of the red and green squares - as if it is
          floating and is not in the normal flow of the document.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Let's breakdown further how our CSS changes lead to this outcome:
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        This <strong>absolute</strong> element has no relationship with the
        container, therefore there is no closest relative positioned parent.
        Hence, it is positioned within the viewport (webpage). Thus value of
        <code>top: 60px</code> and <code>left: 60px</code> means that it will
        move 60px AWAY from the left-side of viewport (hence moved to the right
        of the viewport) AND it will also move 60px AWAY from the top of the
        viewport (hence moved the blue square down from the viewport).
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        To set the relationship between the blue square and container, we need
        to apply <code>position: relative</code> to the container. This will
        lead to:
      </p>
      <p class="example"><em>CSS</em></p>
      <img
        class="screenshot-img"
        src="../images/Absolute-CSS2.png"
        alt="screenshot of CSS"
      />
      <p class="example"><em>Outcome:</em></p>
      <img
        class="screenshot-img"
        src="../images/Absolute-2.png"
        alt="screenshot of CSS"
      />
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Notice how the blue square has moved in relation to the black border
        (container).
      </p>
      <!-- Fixed Position-->
      <h2 class="body-header">Fixed Position</h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Fixed position means it is positioned relative to the viewport/the
        browser window itself, hence it does not respect any relative parents.
        Like absolute positioning - fixed position is removed from the normal
        document flow. The fixed element will be positioned where it is when the
        page is scrolled because the viewport doesn’t change when the window is
        scrolled. For example, this is useful for a navigation bar that you want
        to be visible while a viewer scrolls the page.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">For example:</p>
      <p class="example"><em>CSS</em></p>
      <img
        class="screenshot-img"
        src="../images/Fixed-CSS1.png"
        alt="screenshot of CSS"
      />
      <img
        class="screenshot-img"
        src="../images/Fixed-CSS2.png"
        alt="screenshot of CSS"
      />
      <p class="example"><em>Outcome</em></p>
      <img
        class="screenshot-img"
        src="../images/Fixed.png"
        alt="screenshot of CSS"
      />
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Notice how although the container has
        <code>position: relative</code> specified in the CSS, the blue square is
        positioned relative to the viewport because the blue square is specified
        by <code>position:fixed</code>. If I were to scroll this webpage down,
        the red and green squares will disappear as it is out of the webpage
        view, HOWEVER the blue square will remain in its position due to the
        <strong>fixed positioning</strong> we gave it.
