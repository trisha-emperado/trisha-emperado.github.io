    <!-- Q1-->
    <div class="body">
      <h2 class="body-header">
        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
        you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
        made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
      </h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        I used to work as a Sleep Physiologist in a busy private clinic. There
        were many decisions I had to make that were ethical. To not get too
        technical in my explanation, I will explain a simple ethical decision I
        had to make during my job frequently - whether to wake the patient up to
        fix an electrode.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        It seems simple, but there were a lot of variables that I had to think
        of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Is this a crucial electrode to fix with the trade-off of waking the
          patient up?
        </li>
        <li>
          Was there a back-up electrode that I could use instead for analysis so
          I didn't have to wake patient up?
        </li>
        <li>
          What was the main reason for the patient attending their sleep study
          and is this electrode required to answer their health question?
        </li>
        <li>
          From their medical history, did they have trouble getting back to
          sleep during the night once awake?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        I usually did go in to fix the electrode because patient's paid for
        these expensive studies so it is best that we produce the best quality
        signals for their study. Also, it wasn't just me that was looking into
        the raw data but other Physiologists and Doctors, so signals had to be
        readable.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Reflecting on my decision, I think there were certain circumstances I
        shouldn't have gone in such as for those who experienced insomnia
        (inability to fall asleep) as they were most likely not able to get back
        to sleep once disrupted. But these are things that you learn as you
        continue to grow in your experience.
      </p>
      <br />
      <!-- Q2-->
      <h2 class="body-header">
        Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your
        values and identity.
      </h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        I was born in the Philippines but moved to New Zealand when I was very
        young. Even though we lived far from our home country, my parents
        instilled the importance of our culture, family, and faith since I was
        very young.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        My parents would speak to me in tagalog which is the main spoken
        language in the Philippines, hence I never lost my ability to speak or
        understand tagalog. I used to be self-conscious about it but now I am
        proud of being able to speak a second language. It's also so special to
        me that I can still converse comfortably to my relatives when we go back
        home - to be able to create memories with my Lolo's and Lola's
        (Grandparents).
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Since we don't have any relatives that live in New Zealand, my parents
        have a strong community of other Filipino families that we identify as
        people that are almost blood-related to us. We spend special holidays
        together or even hold the simple weekend barbecue. Family is a very
        important part of the Filipino culture, we value the aspect of
        "together-ness" in our culture. We share our highs and lows with each
        other, support each other where needed without any hesitation, go the
        extra-mile for each other. It's made me realise that community is so
        important in life, and that this life cannot be lived on your own.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        I thank my family for instilling faith in my life. At first my faith was
        just a “cultural” thing that happened every weekend - going to church,
        sitting in a pew, and then going home - and that was it all to me. But
        when I moved out of home and spiralled into a pit of darkness, my faith
        was the only light that helped me out of the pit. It's an experience
        that no one can take from me, and if I didn't have a family and
        community that introduced faith to me - would have I ever escaped the
        darkness? I'm not sure. But maybe that's something I will never know in
        this side of life, and I'm okay with that.
      </p>
      <!-- Q3-->
      <h2 class="body-header">
        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
        learning journey.
      </h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        One of my strengths is that I am hard-working. I do my best in every
        task that is given to me - I like to give my 200% in everything. I think
        this will help motivate me to start study. In order to finish anything,
        we must always begin, even if we have failed in the past -
        <em>nunc coepi</em> (now, I begin).
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        I'm quite a positive person. For example, if I miss the bus then I think
        that maybe I just wan't meant to meet someone in the bus because it then
        have lead to something negative, so even though unfortunate, I have to
        wait for the next bus and possibly be late for my appointment, at least
        it was all to protect me? I think this can help with picking myself up
        when things are just not working with my studies.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        I'm a self-aware person. I tend to know what my needs are in certain
        moments, so I can identify what things need to be changing if they are
        not working.
      </p>
      <!-- Q4-->
      <h2 class="body-header">
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      </h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        With being hard-working person and being a “perfectionist”, these can be
        quite limiting qualities for me. Sometimes, I can get too focused on the
        little details (that sometimes don't matter at all) that I do not move
        on. I can see that this would affect me by possibly delaying my studies.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Time can also be limiting for me. Being a full-time sleep scientist, I
        work 37 hours a week and also do shift-work. I will have to be strict
        with myself in regards to my studies and study in any free time that I
        may have.
      </p>
      <!-- Q5-->
      <h2 class="body-header">
        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
        tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what
        other strategies you would try now and why.
      </h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Working with other people of different backgrounds, personalities and
        skills will sometimes lead to resistance or tension. I used to work with
        a group of about 10 other physiologists and be their lead. Sometimes
        there would be clashes with how we would operate the lab, do our
        set-up's, or have differences in how we would define certain sleep
        events.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Having meetings where everyone is given the opportunity to speak freely
        without judgement was an important way to share and discuss ideas. It
        gave everyone a voice and we could as a team discuss how it best work in
        our team. We also held concordance meetings to make sure that everyone
        was on the same page in regards to the science of our studies so that we
        produced relatively the same results.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        I think the best thing we did was come together regularly even if it was
        just 10 minutes at the start of every week to touch base on how we all
        were, be updated on what we all were expecting in the week ahead, and
        just have a space to raise any issues. The most effective thing to
        relieve built up tension was to have these regular moments to
        communicate with each other.
