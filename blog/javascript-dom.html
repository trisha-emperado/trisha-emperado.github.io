        The Webpage Restaurant: An Analogy To Describe The Relationship Between
        Javascript, HTML, and CSS
      </h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Welcome to The Webpage Restaurant. Here at the Webpage Restaurant, we
        have a restaurant <strong>building</strong>, the
        <strong>design</strong> of the restaurant, and the
        <strong>staff in the restaurant</strong>. <br />
        <br />
        In the context of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, let me explain how these
        three different languages relate to each other with the analogy of the
        <strong>building</strong>, <strong>design</strong>, and the
        <strong>staff of the restaurant</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>HTML</strong> is like the restaurant building. The building is
          the structure of the restaurant such as the foundation, pillars,
          kitchen, pantry, office, toilets, private dining rooms etc. HTML is a
          mark-up language that provides just that - the structure of the
          webpage!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>CSS</strong> is the design of the restaurant. This is the
          curtains, paint or wallpaper on the walls, light fixtures, colour of
          plates, type of tiles in toilets etc. in our restaurant. CSS is a
          language that provides the styling of the structure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Javascript</strong> is the people in the restaurant making it
          run and “feel” alive! - makes the webpage dynamic and interactive. For
          example, without the staff such as the chefs, waiters - it’s just an
          empty shell of a restaurant. So let’s make it more interactive and
          dynamic by adding a staff to greet customers when they come in,
          head-chef and sous-chef, and all the chefs to cook the food, waiters
          to clean and take orders. See how Javascript gives functionality to
          The Webpage Restaurant.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <!-- Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.-->
      <h2 class="body-header">What is the DOM?</h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        <em>DOM DOM DOOOOOOOOOOM *cymbals crashing wildly* </em>
        <br />
        <br />
        The <strong>Document Object Model (DOM)</strong> was something I just
        couldn't get my head around at first. But fear not, if I can understand
        it, you can too.
        <br />
        <br />
        We can only get to understand the DOM once we really start learning
        about Javascript.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Let's begin with an analogy: I like to think of the DOM as the
        “translator” between two people speaking two different foreign
        languages. It is a very smart translator because it can take what was
        said from another language and lay out all the information such as
        context, slang, tone, meaning of each word (even hidden information that
        was not explicitly said, but expressed in conveying that sentence) so
        that the other person can comprehend, process, and make use of the
        information in their own language. It's like the "bridge" between two
        languages.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        The DOM is an Application Programming Interface (API), not a coding
        language. API means that it is a way for a coding language to “talk” to
        another coding language. Because HTML is a different language to
        Javascript, they need an API so that they can “talk” to each other. That
        is when the DOM comes in to play.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        The DOM allows for Javascript to access, add, remove, make changes to
        HTML and CSS.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        How exactly does the DOM do this?
        <br />
        <br />
        It takes the entire HTML document, translates all the content (even all
        the hidden information such as spaces and new lines), and
        <strong>represents</strong> it into standardised objects. It must be
        standardised so that any scripting language, such as Javascript, can
        access and modify the HTML.
        <br />
        <br />
        The DOM is not a copy of the HTML file, it’s just a different way to
        organise the HTML information. For example, you are looking at this web
        page, my blog entry, in your browser. What you are currently seeing is a
        visual representation of the underlying HTML - it’s a way for YOU to
        comprehend the HTML document. The DOM, on the other hand, represents the
        HTML document differently as objects so that scripting languages can
        comprehend (and modify) it.
        <br />
        <br />
        The key word here is <strong>representation</strong>.
        <br />
        <br />
        The DOM is constructed as a tree of objects with hierarchy. Every object
        is under another object, and any object can have multiple children but
        only one parent. If you remove an object from the DOM, all of it’s
        children will also be removed - because each object “possesses” it’s
        children.

      <!-- Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example, 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those).-->
      <h2 class="body-header">
        Let's Talk About <code>Control Flow</code> & <code>Loops</code>
      </h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Computers can run instructions, but they cannot make decisions on their
        own. That’s when we, the programmers, come in! We give computers
        instructions AND give them conditions to use for each set of
        instruction.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        <strong><u>Control Flow:</u></strong>
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        In Javascript it is the order in which the computer runs the full script
        of code. Javascript executes code sequentially meaning it will begin
        from the first line of code and ends at the last line of code, unless
        the computer hits any statement that changes the course of the control
        flow (which happens very frequently).
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        The constructs or statements that change the flow of control are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Conditional - code executed based on the evaluation of conditions.
          Also known as <em>selection</em> constructs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Iterative - code executed <em>repetitively</em> based on the
          evaluation of conditions. Also known as <em>looping</em> constructs.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        <strong><u>Analogy example of Control Flow:</u></strong>
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Let’s go back to our example of the restaurant and we are the first
        person on shift to open and prepare The Webpage Restaurant. A bit of
        context to the restaurant - it’s opening hours are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Monday - Thursday: 6pm - 10pm (serves dinner only)</li>
        <li>Friday - Sunday: 11am - 10PM (serves lunch and dinner)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        We are given a set of instructions to follow before we can open the
        restaurant for customers to come in:
      </p>
      <img
        class="screenshot-img"
        src="../images/JS-Dom-1.png"
        alt="screenshot of instructions"
      />

      <p class="body-paragraph">
        It’s a simple analogy, but the Control Flow is going from instruction
        number one, two, then three. Notice how for each set of instructions
        there are constructs that give them an evaluation of conditions, and for
        each condition there is an instruction. The person reads the first set
        of instructions at the counter, then walk over to the light switch and
        based on the condition will execute the instruction or not, and walk
        back to the instructions at the counter and then follows the next set of
        instructions, and so forth.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Just like our analogy, the control flow in Javascript reads and executes
        code from top to bottom, reading each line of code from the first to the
        end, but for each line of code there can be conditionals or loops that
        can change it’s course.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Understanding Control Flow is important for writing efficient Javascript
        coding. For example, with our analogy above, if the ‘light switch’
        instruction was <em>after</em> the ‘patio doors’ instruction and it was
        a Thursday (serving dinner only in the evening), then it wouldn’t be
        efficient instructions trying to walk to the doors in a dim lit room
        first thing - with our hands stretched out trying to make sure we don’t
        bump into things, and our eyes trying to make sense of what is around
        us. We would be faster to have the lights on to fully see what is in our
        way to the doors, and hence it is better to have these instructions
        first. Just like with programming, we must think of the best way to
        organise our Javascript code so that it is efficient and readable.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        <strong
          ><u>What are <code>loops</code>?</u></strong
        >
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        In Javascript, loops are a block of code that is executed and repeated
        again and again, based on the conditions. It will continue to loop
        through the block of code until the condition returns
        <code>false</code> or if there is nothing left to loop over.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Let’s go back to our Webpage Restaurant analogy to explain this in an
        “every day” setting:
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        It is a Friday, and we are put on the shift to be the first person to
        open the restaurant and prepare before any customers can come through
        the door. We go through the opening instructions, and end up at
        instruction three:
      </p>
      <img
        class="screenshot-img"
        src="../images/JS-Dom-2.png"
        alt="screenshot of instructions"
      />
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Let's say it is 10AM and hence we begin preparing the lunch menu
        booklets. Our task now is to take the stack of menu booklets, starting
        from the first booklet, we open each one and replace the dinner menu
        with the lunch menu, then we close it, put it down, then we open the
        second menu and repeat this again and again until we reach the end of
        the stack of menus (when there is nothing to loop over). This is what
        looping is in Javascript, a task that is repeated, or in programming
        language, they say it is a task that can be <em>iterated</em>.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        The traditional <code>for</code> loop looks something like this:
      </p>
      <img
        class="screenshot-img"
        src="../images/JS-Dom-3.png"
        alt="screenshot of loop code example"
      />
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>initialExpression:</strong> it initialises the loop. Really,
          it’s how many times has it gone through the loop before the execution
          of the first loop. Usually, it is zero. I like to think of
          <code>let i = 0</code> as saying “let’s begin our count at zero”.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>condition:</strong> this is when the condition is evaluated.
          The statement or code in the loop will be executed when the evaluation
          of the condition is <code>true</code>. When it is <code>false</code>,
          the loop is terminated. In our example,
          <code>i < menus.length</code> , I like to think of it as saying “let
          us loop through each menu till we reach the end of the stack of
          menus”.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>updateExpression:</strong> this is executed after each
          iteration of the loop. In our example, <code>i++</code> is saying
          “after executing the condition, open the next menu in the stack”.
          Another way I like to think of it is telling us “what do I do next
          after each executed loop?”, we then answer by telling the loop to
          <code>i++</code> -
          <em>to go to the next loop and do the task again.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Other loops could be: <code>for…in</code> , <code>for…of</code> ,
        <code>ForEach()</code>.

      <h2 class="body-header">
        Arrays and Objects : How Do We Access Their Data?
      </h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Arrays and Objects are ways in Javascript to collect and store data.
        Both are similar in that they are
        <u>mutable</u> variables meaning they are able to change in value.
      </p>

      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Arrays stores a list of data known as
        <strong>elements</strong>. Arrays use zero-based indexing meaning the
        first item is given an index of 0, then the second item one, and so
        forth.
      </p>

      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Objects store collections of data known as
        <strong>properties</strong> - which consist of <strong>keys</strong> and
        <strong>values</strong>.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        <u><strong>Let’s show Arrays and Objects as examples:</strong></u>
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Arrays in our Webpage Restaurant could be our grocery list, and in code
        this will look like:
        <br />
        <code>let groceryList = ['onion', 'flour', 'tomato', 'wine'];</code>
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Objects in our Webpage Restaurant could store the collection of staff
        profiles. <em>Por ejemplo</em>:
        <br />
        <code
          >let staff = { <br />
          name: 'Mary',<br />
          age: 51, <br />
          canCook: true; <br />
          };</code
        >
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        In the above example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>object is <code>staff</code></li>
        <li>
          key is <code>name</code>, <code>age</code>, <code>canCook</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          value is <code>'Mary</code>, <code> 51</code>, <code>true</code>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        <u
          ><strong>
            There are differences in how we can access data from arrays and
            objects:
          </strong></u
        >
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        <em>ARRAYS</em>
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        For arrays we can access elements using
        <strong>square brackets <code>[ ]</code></strong
        >. For example to retrieve the item number 3 from our grocery list, the
        line of code would look like:<br />
        <code>groceryList[3]; // returns 'wine' </code> <br />Remember that
        zero-based indexing is used for arrays, hence the returned element is
        ‘wine’, <em>not</em> 'tomato'.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Arrays can also have elements added and removed from the beginning or
        end of the array using <code>push()</code> to add items at the end of an
        array, <code>pop()</code> to remove the last item from the array,
        <code>unshift()</code> to add items to the beginning of an array, and
        <code>shift()</code> to remove the first item from an array.
        <br />
        <br />
        Arrays can also be iterated through using the <code>for</code> loop,
        <code>for...in</code> , <code>for...of</code>, and
        <code>ForEach()</code> .
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        <em>OBJECTS</em>
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Accessing data from objects, we use either the <strong>dot</strong>
        <code>.</code> notation OR the
        <strong>square bracket <code>[ ]</code></strong> notation.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        ▸ Example One - get the value of a key from an object using both dot
        notation or square brackets:
        <br />
        <code
          >//dot notation:
          <br />
          staff.age // returns 51</code
        >
        <br />
        <br />
        <code
          >//square bracket notation:
          <br />
          staff['age'] // returns 51</code
        >
        <br />
        <br />
        ▸ Example Two - change the value of a key from an object using dot
        notation only:
        <br />
        <code> staff.name = Augustine </code>
        <br />
        <br />

        ▸ Example Three - add a new property to the object using dot notation
        only:
        <br />
        <code>
          staff.medicalConditions = ['allergic to peanuts', 'sleep apnea',
          'diabetes'];</code

        ▸ Example Four: to delete a property from an object using the
        <code>delete</code> operator:
        <br />
        <code> delete staff.canCook </code>
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Objects can also be iterated through however using only the
        <code>for...in</code>, <code>for...of</code>, and
        <code>ForEach</code> loop. If we wanted to use the <code>for</code> loop
        for objects, we first would need to create a variable that is defined to
        go through the object and grabs the keys and values.
        <br />
        For example, we would first create a variable that goes through our
        object :<br />
        <code>let staffNames = Object.keys(staff) </code><br />
        Notice how the ‘Object’ began with a capital ‘O'. Now we can create a
        traditional <code>for</code> loop statement for the object .

        What Are <code>functions</code>? Why Are They Helpful?
      </h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Functions are code in Javascript that is written to perform a specific
        task. Functions always have an input and a return output. They are
        helpful because they can be reused, meaning they can be called anywhere
        in our program which allows you to not write the same code again and
        again. You can use the function just by a single short command, rather
        than typing whole block of code again.
        <br />
        <br />
        Functions must first be defined. The simple way they are defined is
        using this basic syntax:
        <br />
        <code
          >function functionName(parameter) { <br />//statements <br />}
        </code>
        <br />
        <br />
        Just because we defined a function doesn’t mean it will be called!
        Remember to call the function in your script of code. The simple way to
        do this is by writing the name of the function with <code>()</code> .
        For example:
        <br />
        <code>functionName() </code>
      </p>
