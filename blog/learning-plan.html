      <!-- Q1 -->
      <h2 class="body-header">
        What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
      </h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        I want to become a Software Developer after Dev Academy or be able to
        use my coding skills into my current job through research coding. After
        Dev Academy, I also want to build on what I’ve learnt and maybe dive
        into another coding language such as Python.
      </p>
      <!-- Q2 -->
      <h2 class="body-header">
        What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
        Bootcamp?
      </h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        I think my biggest strength remains in that I am hard-working, and quite
        motivated to do all things well.
        <br />
        <br />
        Another limitation that I’ve discovered about me is that I can be quite
        impatient with myself and that I don’t like facing failure. It can take
        quite a lot out of me to face challenges.
      </p>
      <!-- Q3 -->
      <h2 class="body-header">
        What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
        be?
      </h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        I think it will be time-management, keeping focus throughout Bootcamp,
        and being a bit more slow than my peers. I also live in Melbourne
        currently, so maybe my difference may hinder some ability to schedule
        meet-ups (though this hasn’t been a problem through Foundations).
      </p>
      <!-- Q4 -->
      <h2 class="body-header">
        What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        I think it is learning to be patient with myself and facing the fears
        anyway. Because in reality fear will always be present, so I want to
        face the fear anyways, do it afraid until I am not. I don’t want the
        fear to stop me from reaching my greatest potential.
      </p>
      <!-- Q5 -->
      <h2 class="body-header">
        What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?
      </h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Just to be present when I need help and guide me in the right direction.
        I found it helpful asking the Dev Academy team to look through my code
        as to where I was going wrong, and having their trained eye to see where
        I was going wrong.
      </p>
      <!-- Q6 -->
      <h2 class="body-header">
        What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?
      </h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        My expectation of myself is to gain confidence in my technical skills
        that I am able to transition into possibly a new job.
        <br />
        <br />
        I commit to study and practice my coding everyday. I will manage myself
        by scheduling my time precisely. I will work with others in my cohort,
        facilitators, and industry representatives in a respectful, empathetic
        way, and uphold their dignity always.
      </p>

      <!-- Q1 -->
      <h2 class="body-header">
        What is your long term goal or career pathway?
      </h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        My goal is to step into the Software Developing career sphere and begin
        as a Junior Developer. I'm not sure yet whether it will be front-end or
        back-end (or both), however, that is something I will want to figure out
        as I continue with my Dev Academy journey. I hope to maybe work as a
        developer part-time as I slowly transition out of my sleep science role
        and then one day work full-time (depending really where the job market
        will lead me).
      </p>
      <!-- Q2 -->
      <h2 class="body-header">
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning.
      </h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        My strengths lie in my hard-working characteristic and that I like to do
        my best in all tasks provided to me. Especially when it comes to
        learning, I think this helps motivate me to begin studying. This I found
        can also be a limitation because my "perfectionism" doesn't allow me to
        move on. An example of this was when creating my blog, I could see so
        many work-in-progresses that I couldn't overlook although I had already
        gone over the timebox.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        My biggest limitation when it comes to my learning would be time. I work
        full time and shift-work too, so I need to schedule my life well. I find
        creating a google calendar and blocking out time for work helps me see
        where in the week I can fit my studies. My aim is to study every day -
        at least 3 hours and if my schedule doesn't allow then at least 1 hour
        of study (2 pomodoro timers).
      </p>
      <!-- Q3 -->
      <h2 class="body-header">
        What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        As I know that in the tech world communication is key as you will be
        working with a group of people, I want to build on my communication
        skills. To be an effective and efficient communicator . I also want to
        grow in my problem-solving skills - to view challenges without a panic
        and respond proactively.
      </p>
      <!-- Q4 -->
      <h2 class="body-header">
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme:
        <em
          >An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively
          and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community
          representatives</em
        >
      </h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        I will manage my work by planning my calendar and blocking out specific
        times for study so that I stay on top of my workload. I understand that
        when working with a team, we are all each responsible for the tasks
        provided to us and that effective communication is important with other
        students, Facilitators and industry/community representatives. I will
        treat everyone with respect and uphold each person’s dignity.

          you</em
        >
      </h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        I will reach out to my support team - friends and family - when things
        are building up and starting to get to me. I will make sure not to let
        it brew in me and vent it out. I will take time of rests to make sure I
        recuperate so that I come back to my workload with a fresh mind.
      </p>
      <!-- Q5 -->
      <h2 class="body-header">
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        If all things in my life are spiralling down in an extremely negative
        trend, I will reach out to my Facilitators at Dev Academy immediately
        through email or via primate message on Discord. I will make sure to
        communicate before meetings and due dates if I cannot make the meetings,
        and if I cannot hand in my work in time I will provide a reasonable
        explanation.
      </p>
      <!-- Q6 -->
      <h2 class="body-header">
        A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
      </h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        The Facilitation Team, to me, are there to help teach me technical
        skills and build on my core skills required in the tech workforce.
      </p>
      <!-- Q7 -->
      <h2 class="body-header">
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
        commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      </h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Work is main thing for me and my shift is very unpredictable due to my
        shift being dependant on volunteers and their availability. I guess I
        could mention when I will be most be free: Saturday, Sunday, and most
        likely Friday.
