    <div class="body">
      <h2 class="body-header">Neuroplasticity</h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        <strong>What is Neuroplasticity? Let’s break this word up…</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        <em>Neuro</em> refers to neurons, and neurons are the fundamental units
        of the brain and nervous system. <em>Plasticity</em> refers to
        malleability or ability to change. Hence
        <strong>neuroplasticity</strong> is the ability for the nervous system
        to change its activity by reorganising the structure, functions, or
        connections in response to intrinsic or extrinsic stimuli.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        <strong>What is the importance of knowing this? </strong>
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        For a very long time, neuroscientists believed that our brains stopped
        developing in adolescence. They used to believe that a stroke, which
        caused significant motor function, was permanent. But with the
        advancement of our scientific understanding of brain development and
        injury, we are now aware that it is highly active and is malleable.
        Neurons that are frequently used create stronger neural connections.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">That means our brains have the ability to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Learn new things.</li>
        <li>Enhance existing cognitive capabilities.</li>
        <li>Recover from brain injury.</li>
        <li>Strengthen areas where function was lost or declined.</li>
        <li>Improve ‘mental fitness’.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        <strong
          >How might you engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your
          benefit?</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        To me, the information above is <em>hopeful</em>. We are all made with
        great purpose, gifts and talents, and to know that our brain is created
        and structured in way to help us move to wholeness is hopeful.
        <br />
        I did not know a single thing about software development before but I
        always had this curiosity. I would feel anxious whether I would be able
        to get through this programming course at all because I lacked skills in
        math and problem solving. But to be affirmed in that my brain does have
        the ability to develop new neural connections and make existing
        connections stronger, means that I am capable to learn, retain, gain new
        skills, and get through this course. I can do it.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        <strong>How can you increase your neuroplasticity?</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        If you want to gain a new skill, there are five components to promote
        neuroplasticity.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <em>Challenge and Novelty</em>
          <p>
            The skill should be not too easy and new to you. There’s a sense of
            suffering but it’s okay - it only feels this way because it should
            be challenging, and it is new to you so you have never faced it
            before. Face the fears anyways.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Intention</em>
          <p>
            Why do you want to learn this new skill? The new task must have
            meaning, relevance, importance to you. It’s important that it is
            personal to you because engaging in a new task needs to be
            associated with the feeling of being rewarded in order to promote
            neuroplastic change.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Specific Attention</em>
          <p>
            Set a scheduled time to focus on this new skill you are learning.
            Practice makes perfect, right? Improvement in new skills are only
            executed with practice.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Repetition and Intensity</em>
          <p>
            In order to create stronger neural connections, we must repeat tasks
            again and again. It is better to have shorter bouts of intense
            repetitio
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Time</em>
          <p>
            It takes time for changes to occur, so let’s be patient. As the
            natural rhythm of life consist of ebbs and flows, we need to be
            patient with ourselves when there are lapses. This is all part of
            normal life, so remember to refocus, adjust, and
            <strong>just keep swimming.</strong>

      <!-- GROWRTH MINDSET-->
      <h2 class="body-header">Growth Mindset</h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        <strong>What is Growth mindset?</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Before I explain what the ‘growth mindset’ is, I think explaining what
        the ‘fixed mindset’ is will paint a better picture of what the growth
        mindset is through comparison. A fixed mindset is when a person believes
        that their character, intelligence, and creativity is unchangeable.
        Also, it is when a person considers their success to be an affirmation
        of their inherent intelligence. They tend to perceive that maintaining a
        sense of being smart or being skilled is to avoid failure at all costs.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Contrastingly, the growth mindset embraces challenges and failures.
        Failure is not perceived as a sign of unsuccess or no intelligence, but
        as medium for growth. A person with a growth mindset views intelligence,
        abilities, and talents as something that can be learned and can be
        improved with effort and practice.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Having a growth mindset is important because it provides us with a
        healthy relationship to success and failure. People who are learning new
        skills will often face failure, so it is essential to have a growth
        mindset in order to persist despite failure. It will allow people to see
        failure as a path to success and just a stepping-stone in the learning
        process.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        <strong
          >In this exploration, did anything surprise me or change for
          me?</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Reflecting on the growth mindset and with Easter coming up, it just came
        to my head to think of it as the resurrection from death - it seems like
        quite an opposite way to think. It feels like a very unnatural human
        thing to embrace failure in order to have success and reach a high level
        of achievement. I really would rather avoid failure no matter what. But
        just like how the uphill climb on a tramp is always difficult, once you
        reach the peak of the mountain and see all the beauty, you realise that
        the suffering was not at all in vain. That all these challenges and
        failures are avenues for a greater good. Sure, the initial feeling to
        hitting a great big wall that feels impossible to climb is unpleasant,
        and at that moment we say to ourselves in our (really, my) great big
        millennial head, “I am deceased” . But how awesome is it that we are
        capable of unlocking more of ourselves by facing the fear anyways. We’re
        really not made for comfort, we’re made for greatness.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        <strong
          >How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning
          journey?</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        I really don’t like failure at all. I’m the type of person that wants
        the answer to future goals, yesterday. And I think with coming to the
        understanding about the growth mindset, I want to be a person that
        thrives with challenges and be someone that embraces failure.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        As I’m going through this learning journey, I will be self-aware of my
        intelligence and talents as being learnable and that it is not inherent.
        I will change my perception of failure as a negative roadblock into to a
        positive pathway leading to success instead. Try to see every single
        setback, criticism and challenge as ways to grow.

      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        With all the new information that I have learnt about neuroplasticity
        and growth mindset. I have reflected about my learning plan and
        strategy. Here is what I’ve thought about:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Practice everyday</strong>. In order to maintain all that I’ve
          learnt and continue to strengthen my coding skills, I will practice
          and study every day. Even if all I can do is just 30 minutes that day
          due to a busy schedule. I will put in time of effort in my learning as
          it is better to have short bouts of intense repetition. I think this
          will be handy especially during our two week breaks. I also found some
          coding games that I could invite my classmates in doing during our
          break.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >Remind myself of my personal goal which is to learn a new skill. </strong
          >So to remember that I don’t have to prove anyone of my skills and
          that my failures are accepted as part all part of my learning process.
          I have the ability to change and grow. I can develop myself to become
          a good developer.
