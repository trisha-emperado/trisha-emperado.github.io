      <!-- Intro-->
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        I’m okay, truly, but I just experienced lots of problems in the recent
        sprint I did and I want to share this with you.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        I was able to learn about testing, problem solving, pseudocoding, and
        was able to practice and learn more about Javascript during this Sprint.
        However… it was challenging and faced lots of problems. Let me
        elaborate.
      </p>
      <!-- SIMPLE PROBLEM -->
      <h2 class="body-header">I was blocked on a simple problem…</h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        It was the JS Olympics and I was at Event 2 (‘Jumble Your Words’
        challenge). The task was to create a function to reverse a string. I
        thought I had written an elegant piece of code that was correct.
        <br />
        <br />
        Here is what I initially wrote:
      </p>
      <pre> 
      <code> 
        function unjumble(s) {
          return s.split(' ').reverse().join(' ')
        }
      </code>
    </pre>
      <p class="body-paragraph">However, the correct code was:</p>
      <pre> 
        <code> 
          function unjumble(s) {
            return s.split('').reverse().join('')
          }
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Notice the difference? It’s very hard to spot, but where I went wrong
        was how I wrote the <code>' '</code>. What I had written was
        <code>' '</code> which was splitting the string by space, but the
        correct way was to split by character <code>''</code> ! I didn’t even
        notice I was doing this, hence the test was passing a FAIL.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Because I thought I had written a very good piece of code, I knew it was
        going to be a simple fix and I was just missing one simple thing. So I
        went to chatGPT to tell me quickly what I was doing wrong, and that’s
        when it told me what the problem was. Then my eyes were open and I could
        see where I went wrong.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        It was extremely frustrating process to try and see what I was doing
        wrong. I had to read the instructions multiple times (and slowly too),
        read my code repetitively, look at the test files, and just try
        something new, but to no avail - my code was not passing.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        I had to learn through this very simple problem to never overlook the
        little things. Sometimes, it is in the smallest spelling mistake or
        missing characters where the code is going wrong. I definitely had to
        also learn a lot of patience during this time.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <!-- ELEGANT PROBLEM -->
      <h2 class="body-header">
        In saying that, I also elegantly solved a problem…
      </h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        I think I came victorious with the next event in the JS Olympics
        challenge (Event 3 - ‘Odds Out’) because I believe I solved the problem
        a little more elegantly than my experience from the event before.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        The problem was to write a function that accepted an array of numbers
        and return an array with only the even numbers.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        I first read the instructions and thought okay… "how do I want to write
        this code based on what I just learnt in the Kata Challenges?". I kind
        of did my own pseudocode, but in my head. I knew I wanted to use the
        <code>.filter()</code> built-in Javascript method and use the
        <cdde>%</cdde> remainder operator. And with learning that
        <code>.filter()</code> takes only <code>true</code> statements to remain
        and <code>false</code> statements to be filtered out, I knew I wanted to
        make sure that the <cdde>%</cdde> remainder operator resulting in a
        strictly true statement in order for even numbers to remain. And the
        first block of code I typed passed all the tests!
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        I felt extremely gratified when I saw that I passed the test all in one
        go. I think learning to be careful with reading the instructions,
        planning beforehand how you want to type the code before panic googling
        for a solution, and being patient, helped a lot with this elegant
        problem-solving that I experienced.
      </p>

      <!-- REFLECT ON PROBLEM-SOLVING TECHNIQUES-->
      <h2 class="body-header">Let me reflect on problem-solving techniques:</h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        <em>Pseudocode</em>
        <br />
        <br />
        I feel confident using this as it doesn’t require you to have an
        extensive knowledge of programming before using this technique. That is
        because it’s like creating a plan of how you want your code to look like
        before writing the code.
      </p>

      <p class="body-paragraph">
        <em>Trying Something</em>
        <br />
        <br />
        Sometimes you just have to write something to begin. It can be a good
        beginning to writing code but it can be confusing if you are unsure as
        what you’re doing.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        <em>Rubber Ducky Method & Improving your process with reflection</em>
        <br />
        <br />
        This was a helpful trick at concreting new information that I got to
        learn. All of the problems I solved, I explained each piece of code and
        reflected through my online notes/journal which was not only helping at
        ingraining new concepts, but also I could turn back to my notes when I
        forgot what certain things did or if I wanted to use the methods again
        in my new piece of code.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        <em>Reading Error Messages</em>
        <br />
        <br />
        This was extremely helpful when I wanted to see if the problems were
        related to syntax or spelling mistakes.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        <em>Console.logging</em>
        <br />
        <br />
        I have to be honest in that I’m the best at using this technique. I
        relied a lot at reading the test files whether my code passed or not,
        and never used console.log() . It is something I want to learn so I can
        use it as a problem-solving tool for future challenges. I’m sure it was
        created for a helpful reason so I want to use this technique more.
      </p>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        <em>Googling</em>
        <br />
        <br />
        I had to rely a lot on googling as I was stuck on each challenge most of
        the time. I think I am able to write efficient questions on google to
        make sure related links were coming up for me. chatGPT I found helpful
        when asking specific questions when I couldn’t find the answer from
        google or got confused with the multiple different sources that google
        provided.
      </p>
      <!-- REFLECT ON ASKING FOR HELP-->
      <h2 class="body-header">
        Asking Peers For Help & Asking Coaches For Help
      </h2>
      <p class="body-paragraph">
        This is something that I am very bad at. I get very shy using the
        help-desk in Discord and I know I need to utilise this more as that is
        what my peers and coaches are there for.
        <br />
        <br />
        The reluctance mainly comes from thinking my question is a “silly” or
        “simple” question. So I think there is surely an answer out in the web
        instead of showing my vulnerabilities on the help-desk. But this is such
        a negative mindset and I want to be more confident at asking questions
        in Discord. I also usually study at strange hours (due to my shift work)
        or in big study blocks, so I usually need an answer immediately in order
        to move forward with my goal of study for that block.
