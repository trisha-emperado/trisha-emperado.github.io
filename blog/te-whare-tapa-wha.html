        Taking care of my physical wellbeing has been something I‚Äôve been
        wanting to do for a while now. I‚Äôve paused going to the gym for a few
        months now because I had to move to a different location. But now that
        I‚Äôve become familiar with my new environment, I want to go for short
        walks at least 2 times a week. I‚Äôve also been think of trying reformer
        pilates or get back into tennis by joining my local tennis club, so I
        want to give that a go too.

        Giving myself rest is important for me, especially after extremely
        challenging tasks. It helps me to restart tasks with a more positive
        mindset. Ways I rest involve sleep, doing things that interest me and
        give me meaning, and watching Nacho Libre (it just never fails to uplift
        my mood).

      <p class="body-paragraph">
        Prayer is something important to me in forming a connection with God. It
        is also something that I need to be consistent with and something I‚Äôm
        slowly getting more comfortable with. I‚Äôve also grown in friendship with
        two girls who I travelled with in Europe for World Youth Day and we‚Äôve
        been having weekly <em>Lectio Divina</em> since our trip which is
        helping me connect with God.

      <p class="body-paragraph">
        fter moving to a new environment, I felt very lonely because I had lost
        this pillar in my life. I had lost the constant presence of my family
        and I had no friends in my new location. After settling in, I finally
        got the courage to attend a women‚Äôs community group once and was able to
        form friendships with them. I want to take time out of my busy schedule
        to attend their weekly events and cultivate friendships with them.

      <p class="body-paragraph">
        There are lots of new things to try and see when moving locations. I‚Äôm
        still at the stage of settling in and I want to explore more of the new
        city and the natture that I‚Äôm in by going on weekly walks.
